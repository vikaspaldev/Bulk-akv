# Azure Key Vault URI
AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI=https_your-key-vault-name.vault.azure.net/

# Azure Credentials (ensure the service principal has permissions to write secrets)
# For DefaultAzureCredential, these are typically set in the environment
# where the script is run, rather than in the .env file directly.
# However, if you intend to use them directly via dotenv for local development (not recommended for production):
# AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-service-principal-client-id
# AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-ad-tenant-id
# AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-service-principal-client-secret

# Instructions:
# 1. Rename this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure Key Vault URI.
# 3. Ensure your environment is configured for DefaultAzureCredential.
#    This might mean you're logged in via Azure CLI, or have environment variables
#    like AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET set.
#    Refer to Azure SDK for JavaScript documentation for more on DefaultAzureCredential.
